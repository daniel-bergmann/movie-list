# movie-list
A project in the academy of web development


I have made a movie list application that you can use to add movies you want to watch.

After you watched them you are able to remove them from the list aswell.

The code was written with ES6 classes and then I used Babel to transpile it into ES5 code so most browsers can render it.

Heres a link to the webapp:

Enjoy!
